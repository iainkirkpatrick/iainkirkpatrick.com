<div class="mt-12 prose">
Hello! I'm Iain.

For quite a while I was a director, software engineer and tech lead at [Bamboo Creative](https://bamboocreative.nz), a digital agency based in Wellington, New Zealand. I still am, until the end of 2023, but I'm also taking some time to reflect and think about _the next thing_.

I'm one of the ones who went through a web development bootcamp ([Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/), 2015). Prior to switching to software full-time, I worked as a GIS analyst and cartographer in various government departments in New Zealand.

I'm now living in Canberra, Australia, and have been working remotely across global timezones for the past three years.

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) for content authoring. I'm using Cloudflare for hosting and their Workers AI product for the LLM inference on the home page.

It's all open-source - check out the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/iainkirkpatrick/iainkirkpatrick.com), and read more about how I built the site in [this thought](/thoughts/2023-12-7-rebuild).
