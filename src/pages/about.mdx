Hello! I'm Iain.

For quite a while I was a director, software engineer and tech lead at [Bamboo Creative](https://bamboocreative.nz), a digital agency based in Wellington, New Zealand (though I worked remotely since 2021). I'm now taking some time to reflect and look for _the next thing_.

I'm one of the ones who went through a web development bootcamp ([Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/), 2015). 

I'm based in Canberra, Australia.
