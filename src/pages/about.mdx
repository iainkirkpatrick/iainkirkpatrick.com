<div class="my-12 prose">
Hello! I'm Iain.

For the last six years or so I was a director, tech lead and software engineer at [Bamboo Creative](https://bamboocreative.nz), a digital agency based in Wellington, New Zealand. I'm currently continuing to contract ad-hoc to Bamboo, but I'm also taking some time to reflect and think about _the next thing_.

Before Bamboo, I co-founded a software co-operative called [Root Systems](https://github.com/root-systems/), where we experimented with in-house software and novel approaches to running an organisation i.e. our [financial agreements](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/a-new-financial-model-for-consulting-c7781661a1ec). 

I'm one of the ones who went through a web development bootcamp ([Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/), 2015). Prior to switching to software full-time, I worked as a GIS analyst and cartographer in various government departments in New Zealand.

I'm now living in Canberra, Australia, and have been working remotely across global timezones for the past three years.
