my personal blog / portfolio. subject to wild stylistic change as the mood strikes.

issues:
- would be ideal to not reload the entire page for each blog post... hackery with how Jekyll expects posts to be handled?
  - is it possible that React Router could help? http://rackt.github.io/react-router/
