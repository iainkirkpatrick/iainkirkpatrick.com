## todo:
- [ ] fix local dev for ai worker - might need to run in [advanced mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/advanced-mode/) with the Module Worker syntax
  - looks like you can't yet create a binding from a Pages function to a Vectorize worker either... or even a binding from a Pages function to another Pages function.
